	</p>
	<h2>
		Slow Performance
	</h2>
	<p>
		In any video game, it is possible that the code will run slower in some situations, resulting in choppy animation. These situations can be caused by background applications or the operating system, which Rebel Software has no control over. Rebel Software offers no refunds to players who lose lives due to choppy animation.
